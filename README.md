# Applicaiton Development Info
This application was originally developed by the authour to demonstrate the capabilities of the Oculus Rift VR googles and the Leap Motion 3D sensor for a possible museum exhibit. It has since been modified to allow keyboard input and desktop monitor viewing.

The moving 3D sprites were modelled and animated in Blender and textured using GIMP. Each sprite was created from 2D images of prehistoric arthropods.

All environment assets and textures were obtained from the Unity Asset Store and Unity Standard Assets.
